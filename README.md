K-means hands-on
=========================

Based on 'machine learning in action'

> In a nutshell, clustering focuses on the following question: given a set of observations,
> can the computer figure out a way to classify them into “meaningful groups”? The major
> difference with Classification methods is that in clustering, the Categories / Groups are
> initially unknown: it’s the algorithm’s job to figure out sensible ways to group items into
> Clusters, all by itself (hence the word “unsupervised”).
